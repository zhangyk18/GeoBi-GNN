# GeoBi-GNN

This repository is for the mesh denoising paper accepted by **Computer-Aided Design**:

* GeoBi-GNN: Geometry-aware Bi-domain Mesh Denoising via Graph Neural Networks. [[paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448521001639)]

The dataset for training can be downloaded from the paper **Mesh Denoising via Cascaded Normal Regression.** [[data](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ar9egoTYLACXkAaghJi0-fAFei52?e=3FerBP)]
Thanks for their excellent work.
